# TheMovieApp

The Movies App is a simple project where the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design architecture is applied with RxSwift (Reactive Programming).
The app simply consults an api where it brings a list of the most popular movies and shows them in a table, 
there is also a search engine and a details window for the movies!
